          <h3>The brother-sister duo that started it all.</h3>
          <p>Soul was born out of two siblingsâ€™ passion for the benefits of wellness. Co-founders Angie Lee, serial entrepreneur, and Mike Lee, world-ranked boxer, have each experienced the powers of supplements. They are a powerhouse duo who have had to (literally) fight their way to the top of their respective industries.
